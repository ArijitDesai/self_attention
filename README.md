# self_attention
Implementation of Self-Attention from Scratch Using PyTorch. This repository demonstrates how the self-attention mechanism works step-by-step with a simple example sentence, using concepts like Query, Key, and Value vectors. Includes detailed comments and analogies to explain the fundamentals of self-attention in natural language processing (NLP).
